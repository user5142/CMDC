# CMDC

CMDC stands for Central Massachusetts Developers Club.

I created the fictitious CMDC brand and <a href="https://user5142.github.io/CMDC/" target="_blank">website</a> for a project as part of Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path. The project assignment was to create a responsive and optimized website for a club of your choosing, either real or imagined.

I utilized CSS Flexbox and media query techniques to optimize the site across screen sizes. I also created a simple CMDC club logo and opted for a dark themed design.
